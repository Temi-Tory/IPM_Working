GeneralizedCriticalPathModule README - Mathematical Foundations:
1. Time Critical Path Analysis (time_critical_path)
Question: "What's the earliest completion time for each task and the overall project duration?"
Mathematical How:
julia# Forward pass with exact NonNegativeTime calculations
for each node v in topological order:
    if v is source:
        completion[v] = project_start + task_duration[v]
    else:
        completion[v] = max(completion[parent] + edge_delay[parent→v]) + task_duration[v]
                       for all parents
Mathematical Foundation: Critical Path Method (CPM) with exact time arithmetic

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Optimality: Finds earliest possible completion times
Type Safety: NonNegativeTime prevents negative time errors

2. Cost Critical Path Analysis (cost_critical_path)
Question: "What's the most expensive path to each node and the maximum total project cost?"
Mathematical How:
julia# Additive cost accumulation with maximum path selection
for each node v in topological order:
    if v is source:
        cost[v] = start_cost + node_cost[v]
    else:
        cost[v] = max(cost[parent] + edge_cost[parent→v]) + node_cost[v]
                 for all parents
Mathematical Foundation: Longest path problem in DAG with additive costs

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Optimality: Finds maximum cost path (critical for budget planning)

3. Bottleneck Analysis (bottleneck_analysis)
Question: "What's the minimum capacity along the best path to each node (maximum bottleneck path)?"
Mathematical How:
julia# Minimum capacity propagation with widest path selection
for each node v in topological order:
    if v is source:
        capacity[v] = min(initial_capacity, node_capacity[v])
    else:
        capacity[v] = max over parents p of:
            min(capacity[p], edge_capacity[p→v], node_capacity[v])
Mathematical Foundation: Widest path problem (maximum bottleneck shortest path)

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Optimality: Finds globally optimal bottleneck path

4. Risk Analysis (risk_analysis)
Question: "What's the maximum accumulated risk along paths to each node?"
Mathematical How:
julia# Risk accumulation with worst-case combination (no independence assumption)
for each node v in topological order:
    if v is source:
        risk[v] = base_risk + node_risk[v]
    else:
        # Exact worst-case risk (maximum of parent risks)
        risk[v] = max(risk[parent] + edge_risk[parent→v]) + node_risk[v]
                 for all parents
Mathematical Foundation: Conservative risk analysis without statistical independence

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Optimality: Provides worst-case risk bounds (mathematically sound)

5. Generalized Critical Path Analysis (critical_path_analysis)
Question: "What's the critical value for any custom metric using configurable mathematical operations?"
Mathematical How:
julia# Configurable three-stage process
for each node v in topological order:
    if v is source:
        value[v] = node_function(initial_value, node_values[v])
    else:
        # Stage 1: Propagate through edges
        propagated_values = [propagation_function(value[parent], edge_values[parent→v])
                           for parent in parents[v]]
        
        # Stage 2: Combine multiple parents
        combined_input = combination_function(propagated_values)
        
        # Stage 3: Apply node processing
        value[v] = node_function(combined_input, node_values[v])
Mathematical Foundation: Generalized dynamic programming with configurable operations

Time Complexity: O(V + E) × complexity of custom functions
Optimality: Depends on mathematical properties of chosen functions


Mathematical Relationships Between Algorithms
Function Mapping:
julia# Time Analysis
combination_function = max_combination      # Latest prerequisite time
propagation_function = additive_propagation # Add delays  
node_function = additive_propagation       # Add task duration

# Cost Analysis  
combination_function = max_combination      # Most expensive path
propagation_function = additive_propagation # Add edge costs
node_function = additive_propagation       # Add node costs

# Bottleneck Analysis
combination_function = min_combination      # Find bottleneck
propagation_function = min_propagation     # Capacity-limited
node_function = min_propagation           # Node capacity limit

# Risk Analysis
combination_function = max_combination      # Worst-case scenario
propagation_function = additive_propagation # Add edge risks  
node_function = additive_propagation       # Add node risks
Convergence Properties:




Slack Definitions:
julia# Additive Slack (Time/Cost)
slack[node] = critical_value - node_value

# Multiplicative Slack (Reliability/Scaling)
slack[node] = critical_value / node_value  

# Custom Slack
slack[node] = slack_function(critical_value, node_value)
Backtracking Methods:
julia# For additive systems (exact inverse)
expected_input = output - node_value

# For multiplicative systems (exact inverse)
expected_input = output / node_value

# For max systems (indeterminate inverse)
if output > node_value: input = output
else: multiple solutions or no solution exists







All critical path variants are solvable in O(V+E) time using the same topologically sorted iteration set
