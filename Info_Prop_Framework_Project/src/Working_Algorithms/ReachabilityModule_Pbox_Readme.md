# =================================
# P-BOX VERSION SCALING LIMITATIONS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
# =================================
#
# SUMMARY:
# The p-box implementation provides high-fidelity uncertainty propagation but 
# suffers from severe computational scaling issues that make it impractical 
# for large, complex networks. Testing across different network types shows:
# - Metro networks: Feasible (minutes to hours depending on diamond structure complexity)
# - Grid networks: Works well (simpler structure, fewer nested diamonds)
# - Substation networks: Works well (typically smaller, less complex)
# - Municipal networks: Intractable (hours to weeks depending on diamond nesting levels)

# COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS

## Root Cause: Convolution-Based Arithmetic

Every arithmetic operation in the p-box version involves discrete convolution 
over ~200 discretization steps, transforming O(1) operations into O(n²) operations:

### Float64 Version:
- Basic multiplication: `a * b` → 1 operation
- Addition: `a + b` → 1 operation  
- Belief update: `prior * evidence` → 1 operation

### P-box Version:
- Basic multiplication: `PBA.convIndep(a, b, op=*)` → ~40,000 operations (200²)
- Addition: `PBA.convIndep(a, b, op=+)` → ~40,000 operations
- Belief update: Same convolution overhead

## Scaling Analysis by Network Type

### Network Types That Work Well:
- **Grid Networks**: Regular structure, predictable diamond patterns, moderate size
- **Substation Networks**: Typically smaller scale, hierarchical structure
- **Metro Networks**: Medium complexity, manageable diamond nesting

### Network Types That Struggle:
- **Municipal Networks**: Large scale + complex diamond nesting = computational explosion
- **Dense Urban Networks**: High connectivity leads to many nested diamond structures
- **Regional Networks**: Scale overwhelms p-box arithmetic capabilities

## Memory Consumption

Each p-box stores:
- ~200 discretization points × 8 bytes = 1.6KB base
- Additional metadata and intermediate arrays = ~4-8KB total
- vs Float64: 8 bytes

For large networks:
- Memory usage scales as: (nodes × edges × ~8KB per p-box)
- Municipal-scale networks can require tens of GB of RAM
- vs Float64 equivalent: hundreds of MB

## Critical Bottlenecks

### 1. Diamond Structure Conditioning
The most expensive operation in `pbox_updateDiamondJoin()`:

```julia
# For C conditioning nodes, enumerate 2^C states
for state_idx in 0:(2^C - 1)
    # Each state calculation involves multiple convolutions
    state_probability = PBA.convIndep(...)  # O(n²)
    complement_belief = PBA.convIndep(...)  # O(n²)
    # ... more convolutions per state
end
```

**Complexity explosion:**
- C=3: 8 states × 40K ops/state = 320K operations
- C=5: 32 states × 40K ops/state = 1.28M operations  
- C=7: 128 states × 40K ops/state = 5.12M operations

Municipal networks often have diamonds with C=5-8 conditioning nodes, while
grid and substation networks typically have simpler diamond structures.

### 2. Inclusion-Exclusion with P-boxes
The `pbox_inclusion_exclusion()` function scales as O(2^k × n²) where:
- k = number of belief sources to combine
- n = discretization steps (200)

For nodes with many parents:
- 5 parents: 32 combinations × 40K ops = 1.28M operations
- 7 parents: 128 combinations × 40K ops = 5.12M operations

### 3. Nested Diamond Proliferation
Municipal networks exhibit:
- Diamonds within diamonds (exponential complexity growth)
- High node degree (many parents per node)
- Complex interdependencies that create deep conditioning chains

Grid/substation networks typically have:
- Simpler, more regular diamond patterns
- Lower average node degree
- More predictable computational complexity

## Why P-boxes Don't Scale to Municipal Networks

### 1. Fundamental Algorithm Complexity
- P-box arithmetic is inherently O(n²) per operation
- Cannot be optimized below this complexity
- Every uncertainty operation compounds the cost

### 2. Network Structure Complexity
- Municipal networks have complex, nested diamond structures
- High connectivity leads to exponential conditioning complexity
- Regular grid networks avoid worst-case complexity patterns

### 3. Memory and Computational Requirements
- Continuous allocation/deallocation of large arrays
- Cache misses due to large working sets
- Memory fragmentation in long-running computations

### 4. Diamond Structure Characteristics by Network Type

| Network Type | Typical Diamonds | Conditioning Nodes | Complexity |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Grid        | Simple, regular  | 2-4 per diamond   | Manageable |
| Substation  | Hierarchical     | 2-3 per diamond   | Low        |
| Metro       | Moderate         | 3-5 per diamond   | Medium     |
| Municipal   | Complex, nested  | 5-8+ per diamond  | Explosive  |

## Alternative Approaches for Large Networks

### 1. Interval Arithmetic (Recommended)
- Orders of magnitude speedup over p-boxes
- Still captures uncertainty bounds  
- Scales linearly with network size
- Conservative but tractable for all network types

### 2. Weighted Probability Slices
- Significant speedup over p-boxes (with 5-10 slices)
- Captures distribution shape
- Tunable precision vs performance
- Good compromise for medium-complexity networks

### 3. Hybrid Approaches
- Use Float64 for initial screening
- Apply p-boxes to critical subnetworks only
- Network-type-specific precision strategies

### 4. Sampling-Based Methods
- Monte Carlo approximation
- Parallelizable computation
- Scales well with modern hardware
- Statistical rather than analytical bounds

## Recommendations by Network Type

### For Grid/Substation Networks (< 1000 nodes):
- P-box version feasible for high-precision analysis
- Consider p-box for critical path analysis
- Interval version for routine operational analysis

### For Metro Networks (medium complexity):
- P-box version may be feasible depending on diamond complexity
- Test performance on representative subnetworks first
- Interval version recommended for operational use

### For Municipal Networks (large, complex):
1. **Primary**: Use interval arithmetic version
2. **Enhanced**: Add slice-based version for critical components  
3. **Research**: Reserve p-box version for small, critical subproblems
4. **Operational**: Float64 version for real-time applications

## Network Complexity Assessment

Before choosing p-box implementation, evaluate:
- Total number of nodes and edges
- Average diamond structure complexity
- Maximum conditioning nodes per diamond
- Available computational resources and time constraints

The p-box approach provides theoretical rigor but is computationally prohibitive
for large-scale, complex network analysis.
