SUB-DIAMOND NESTING ANALYSIS
============================

• No sub-diamond nesting detected in current analysis

CACHE IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS
===================================

1. HIGH PRIORITY: Implement edge pattern caching - 624 repeated patterns detected
2. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Cache conditioning state results - 1383 repeated conditioning patterns

SUMMARY STATISTICS
==================
• Total diamonds processed: 1411
• Cache hit potential: 624 repeated computations
• Performance improvement estimate: 44.2% reduction in computations
• Memory vs. Speed tradeoff: Favorable for patterns with >2 occurrences

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
======================
1. Edge pattern caching (highest ROI)
2. Conditioning state memoization
3. Sub-diamond result caching
4. Belief propagation result caching for expensive operations
