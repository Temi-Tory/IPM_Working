Updated Algorithm Portfolio - Mathematical Foundations:
1. Maximum Flow Capacity Analysis (maximum_flow_capacity)
Question: "What's the maximum sustainable flow rate each node can process given BOTH network infrastructure AND processing constraints?"
Mathematical How:
julia# Topological processing with dual constraints
for each node v in topological order:
    if v is source:
        flow[v] = min(source_rate[v], node_capacity[v])
    else:
        incoming_flow = Σ(min(flow[parent], edge_capacity[parent→v]))
        flow[v] = min(incoming_flow, node_capacity[v])
Mathematical Foundation: Flow conservation + capacity constraints

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Optimality: Guaranteed optimal for DAGs with processing constraints

2. Classical Maximum Flow Analysis (classical_maximum_flow)
Question: "What's the theoretical maximum flow possible if we had unlimited processing power?"
Mathematical How:
julia# Topological processing with edge-only constraints
for each node v in topological order:
    if v is source:
        flow[v] = source_rate[v]  # No processing limit
    else:
        flow[v] = Σ(min(flow[parent], edge_capacity[parent→v]))
        # No node capacity constraint applied
Mathematical Foundation: Classical max flow for DAGs (Ford-Fulkerson family)

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Optimality: Provides theoretical upper bound

3. Bottleneck/Widest Path Analysis (bottleneck_capacity_analysis)
Question: "What's the highest guaranteed single-path throughput (maximum bottleneck path)?"
Mathematical How:
julia# Dynamic programming for widest path
for each node v in topological order:
    if v is source:
        width[v] = min(source_rate[v], node_capacity[v])
    else:
        width[v] = max over parents p of:
            min(width[p], edge_capacity[p→v], node_capacity[v])
Mathematical Foundation: Bellman-Ford variant for bottleneck shortest paths

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Optimality: Finds globally optimal widest path (maximum minimum capacity)

4. Comparative Analysis (comparative_capacity_analysis)
Question: "Where's the biggest capacity gap and investment opportunity?"
Mathematical How:
julia# Gap analysis with statistical metrics
capacity_gap[v] = classical_flow[v] - realistic_flow[v]
processing_limitation[v] = capacity_gap[v] / classical_flow[v]
efficiency = Σ(realistic_flow) / Σ(classical_flow)

# Investment impact scoring
for each node v:
    impact_ratio[v] = capacity_gap[v] / current_capacity[v]
    ROI_potential[v] = capacity_gap[v] / upgrade_cost[v]
Mathematical Foundation: Comparative analysis + optimization theory

Time Complexity: O(V + E) for both analyses + O(V) for comparison
Insight: Quantifies Pareto improvement opportunities


Mathematical Relationships Between Algorithms
Fundamental Inequalities:
julia# Mathematical guarantees
widest_path_flow[v] ≤ realistic_flow[v] ≤ classical_flow[v]

# Efficiency bounds  
0 ≤ realistic_flow[v]/classical_flow[v] ≤ 1

# Capacity gap decomposition
classical_flow[v] = realistic_flow[v] + processing_gap[v]
Convergence Properties:

Algorithm 1 & 2: Converge in single topological pass (O(V+E))
Algorithm 3: Converges to global optimum via dynamic programming
Algorithm 4: Linear combination of algorithms 1 & 2 (inherits their properties)

Optimality Guarantees:

DAG Structure: Enables optimal solutions without cycles/negative cuts
Topological Processing: Ensures optimal substructure property
Greedy Feasibility: Local optimal choices lead to global optimum

Summary:
Each algorithm solves a different mathematical capacity optimization problem:

Constrained Flow: max Σf(v) subject to edge + node constraints
Unconstrained Flow: max Σf(v) subject to edge constraints only
Bottleneck Path: max min{capacities along path}
Gap Optimization: argmax{capacity_gap[v]/cost[v]}

All four problems are solvable in O(V+E) time due to the DAG topological sorted structure!
