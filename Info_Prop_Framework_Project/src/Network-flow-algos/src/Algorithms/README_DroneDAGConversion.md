# Sophisticated Drone Network DAG Conversion

This directory contains a sophisticated approach for converting undirected drone feasibility graphs to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) while preserving operational meaning and network properties.

## Overview

The drone network DAG conversion system addresses the challenge of transforming undirected feasibility connections into meaningful directed flows that respect:
- **Operational Context**: Supply distribution, emergency response, resilience analysis
- **Geographic Hierarchy**: Strategic positioning and hub relationships  
- **Network Properties**: Connectivity, capacity, and flow constraints
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Coordination between different drone capabilities

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Operational Architecture

The system supports three distinct operational modes:

#### Supply Distribution Mode
- **Purpose**: Optimize medical supply delivery from hubs to hospitals
- **Flow Pattern**: Airports → Regional Hubs → Local Hubs → Hospitals
- **Optimization**: Hub-centric hierarchy with geographic efficiency
- **Use Case**: Regular supply chain operations

#### Emergency Response Mode  
- **Purpose**: Minimize response time for critical medical deliveries
- **Flow Pattern**: Speed-optimized routing with airport priority
- **Optimization**: Connectivity-focused with reduced hierarchy constraints
- **Use Case**: Emergency medical supply deployment

#### Resilience Analysis Mode
- **Purpose**: Analyze network robustness under failure conditions
- **Flow Pattern**: Balanced approach emphasizing redundancy
- **Optimization**: Infrastructure capability and geographic distribution
- **Use Case**: Network vulnerability assessment and contingency planning

### 2. Four-Tier Node Classification

```
Tier 1: AIRPORTS        (Highest Priority)
├── Multi-modal hubs
├── Strategic transfer points
└── Long-range capability

Tier 2: REGIONAL_HUBS   (High Priority)  
├── Major distribution centers
├── Health board coordination
└── Regional coverage

Tier 3: LOCAL_HUBS      (Medium Priority)
├── Local distribution points
├── Community coverage
└── Last-mile coordination

Tier 4: HOSPITALS       (Delivery Targets)
├── End destinations
├── Critical infrastructure
└── Service delivery points
```

### 3. Hierarchical Scoring Algorithm

Node importance combines multiple factors:

```julia
importance_score = (
    α × operational_importance +    # 30-40% - Node type hierarchy
    β × geographic_centrality +     # 20-30% - Spatial positioning  
    γ × network_connectivity +      # 20-40% - Degree centrality
    δ × infrastructure_capability   # 10-20% - Combined capacity
)
```

Weights (α, β, γ, δ) vary by operational mode to optimize for different objectives.

### 4. Intelligent Cycle Resolution

The system uses domain-aware strategies for breaking cycles:

#### Geographic Cycles
- Preserve natural flow patterns (north-south, urban-rural)
- Maintain regional connectivity
- Respect topological constraints

#### Operational Cycles  
- Prioritize supply chain directionality
- Maintain hub-to-hospital flows
- Preserve emergency response paths

#### Capacity Cycles
- Consider infrastructure limitations
- Respect drone capability constraints
- Maintain feasible flow volumes

#### Temporal Cycles
- Account for operational scheduling
- Preserve time-critical pathways
- Maintain service level agreements

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```julia
using DroneNetworkDagModule

# 1. Classify your nodes
node_types = [HOSPITAL, AIRPORT, REGIONAL_HUB, ...]  # 244 nodes
node_coordinates = [...] # [lat, lon] for each node

# 2. Create converter for supply distribution
converter = DroneNetworkDAGConverter(
    node_types, 
    node_coordinates, 
    SUPPLY_DISTRIBUTION
)

# 3. Convert undirected adjacency matrix to DAG
dag, results = convert_drone_network_to_dag(
    converter, 
    undirected_adjacency_matrix
)

# 4. Analyze results
validation = results["validation"]
println("Hospital Reachability: $(validation["hospital_reachability"] * 100)%")
println("Edge Retention: $(validation["edge_retention_rate"] * 100)%")
```

### Multi-Modal Integration

```julia
# Convert both drone networks
drone1_dag, _ = convert_drone_network_to_dag(converter, drone1_adj)
drone2_dag, _ = convert_drone_network_to_dag(converter, drone2_adj)

# Create integrated multi-modal network
integrated_dag = max.(drone1_dag, drone2_dag)

# Identify transfer nodes
transfer_nodes = find_transfer_opportunities(drone1_dag, drone2_dag)
```

### Integration with IPA Framework

```julia
# Use with existing IPA modules
using ReachabilityModule, DiamondClassificationModule

# Reachability analysis
reachability_results = analyze_reachability(dag, source_nodes, target_nodes)

# Diamond structure detection  
diamond_results = classify_diamonds(dag)

# Critical path analysis
critical_paths = find_critical_paths(dag, edge_weights)
```
