SCALED POWER NETWORK
===================

This network scales up the original power network pattern while maintaining:
• Sparse connectivity (similar nodes:edges ratio)
• Mostly linear topology with minimal diamonds
• Realistic power grid reliability parameters
• Tractable for exact path enumeration

Structure: Multiple interconnected replicas of the original 23-node power network
Node Types:
  • Generation nodes (1-8 in each replica): 75-90% reliability
  • Transmission nodes (9-23 in each replica): 90-95% reliability
Edge Types:
  • Intra-replica connections: 85-95% reliability
  • Inter-replica bridges: 80-90% reliability
