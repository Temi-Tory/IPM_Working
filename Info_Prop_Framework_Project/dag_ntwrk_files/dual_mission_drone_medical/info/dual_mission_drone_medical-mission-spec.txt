DUAL MISSION SCOTTISH MEDICAL SUPPLY NETWORK
==========================================

Mission A: Northern Scotland Emergency Supply
  Target: Highland and Aberdeen region medical facilities
  Nodes: 115 facilities

Mission B: Central Belt Medical Supply
  Target: Glasgow-Edinburgh corridor facilities
  Nodes: 126 facilities

Shared Resources: Strategic Airports & Major Hospitals
  Nodes: 3 shared hubs
  Function: Enable cross-mission resource allocation

Network Complexity:
  • Total nodes: 244
  • Total edges: 303
  • Expected exact algorithm performance: Intractable
  • Expected your algorithm performance: ~25-35 seconds

This network demonstrates scalability to full Scottish medical infrastructure
while maintaining controlled complexity through dual mission architecture.
