HYBRID POWER-HIERARCHICAL DRONE NETWORK
========================================

This network combines two proven topologies:
  • Power backbone: Linear structure from scaled-power-5x
  • Hierarchical clusters: Dense hub-spoke structures embedded at strategic points
  • Cross-topology connections: Bridge edges creating new diamond opportunities

Network Architecture:
  • Total nodes: 782
  • Total edges: 2789
  • Power backbone nodes: 115
  • Cluster centers: 23
  • Hierarchical nodes per cluster: ~244

Expected Complexity:
  • Linear backbone diamonds from power topology
  • Dense local diamonds from hierarchical clusters
  • Cross-topology diamonds from backbone-cluster interactions
  • Target processing time: 10-60 seconds

This hybrid approach maximizes diamond formation while maintaining
realistic Scottish drone infrastructure constraints.
