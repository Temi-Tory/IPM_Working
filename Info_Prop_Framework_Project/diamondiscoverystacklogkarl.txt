     ‚Ä¢ Total lookup targets: 10
     ‚Ä¢ Lookup success rate: 40.0%

     üî¨ FAILURE ANALYSIS:
       ‚Ä¢ Wrong lookups: 6 (found diamond but can't use it)
         - Primary cause: Conditioning conflicts with excluded nodes
         - Solution: Add conflicted joins to fresh computation call

     üî¨ FAILURE ANALYSIS:
       ‚Ä¢ Wrong lookups: 1 (found diamond but can't use it)

     üî¨ FAILURE ANALYSIS:
       ‚Ä¢ Wrong lookups: 8 (found diamond but can't use it)
         - Primary cause: Conditioning conflicts with excluded nodes
         - Solution: Add conflicted joins to fresh computation call

     ‚Ä¢ Total lookup targets: 6
     ‚Ä¢ Lookup success rate: 16.7%

     üî¨ FAILURE ANALYSIS:
       ‚Ä¢ Wrong lookups: 5 (found diamond but can't use it)
         - Primary cause: Conditioning conflicts with excluded nodes
         - Solution: Add conflicted joins to fresh computation call
     üéØ OPTIMIZATION VERDICT:
       ‚ùå POOR: Lookup optimization may not be reliable for this case
       üí° HYBRID APPROACH: Use identify_and_group_diamonds([current_join] + failed_joins)
         - This would still optimize successful lookups while handling failures

     üî¨ FAILURE ANALYSIS:

         - Primary cause: Conditioning conflicts with excluded nodes

     ‚Ä¢ Failed lookups: 6
     ‚Ä¢ Missing lookups: 0
     ‚Ä¢ Total lookup targets: 7
     ‚Ä¢ Lookup success rate: 14.3%
     ‚Ä¢ Current approach: identify_and_group_diamonds(9 joins)
     ‚Ä¢ Optimized approach: identify_and_group_diamonds(1 current + 6 failed lookups)
     ‚Ä¢ Computation reduction: 22.2%
     üî¨ FAILURE ANALYSIS:
       ‚Ä¢ Wrong lookups: 6 (found diamond but can't use it)
         - Primary cause: Conditioning conflicts with excluded nodes
         - Solution: Add conflicted joins to fresh computation call
     üéØ OPTIMIZATION VERDICT:
       ‚ùå POOR: Lookup optimization may not be reliable for this case
       üí° HYBRID APPROACH: Use identify_and_group_diamonds([current_join] + failed_joins)
