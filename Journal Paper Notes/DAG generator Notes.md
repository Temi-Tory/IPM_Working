DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) generation approaches in the context of nuclear decommissioning and complex civil infrastructure.

1. NFJ (Nested Fork-Join):
- Perfect for systematic, highly regulated processes where safety and procedure adherence is critical
- Ideal for nuclear decommissioning tasks that must happen in a specific order with clear checkpoints
- Examples:
  - Reactor dismantling where certain components must be removed in parallel but with strict synchronization points
  - Radiation monitoring and containment procedures that require concurrent but controlled processes
  - Safety system deactivation sequences where multiple subsystems need coordinated shutdown
- The structured nature helps with:
  - Regulatory compliance tracking
  - Safety protocol enforcement
  - Clear audit trails
  - Quality assurance checkpoints

2. RND (Layer-by-Layer):
- Well-suited for processes that have natural stages but with flexibility within each stage
- Good for facilities with multiple interconnected systems that need partial independence
- Examples:
  - Utility disconnection processes where different systems (water, electricity, ventilation) have some independence but still need coordination
  - Waste processing workflows where different types of materials can be handled in parallel with some flexibility
  - Site cleanup operations where different areas can be processed simultaneously but must maintain some sequential order
- The balanced structure helps with:
  - Resource allocation across stages
  - Managing parallel work crews
  - Handling unexpected discoveries or issues within stages
  - Maintaining overall project progression while allowing tactical flexibility

3. RND_LEGACY:
You're right - the flexibility IS a good thing for your context! Here's why:
- Perfect for modeling real-world infrastructure with complex interdependencies
- Ideal for scenarios where you need to represent:
  - Long-range dependencies (e.g., how early-stage contamination might affect final-stage cleanup)
  - Complex system interactions (e.g., how the decommissioning of one component might affect seemingly unrelated systems)
  - Unexpected pathways and relationships
  - Legacy system dependencies that might not be immediately obvious

For your specific use case of nuclear decommissioning and complex civil infrastructure, I would suggest:

1. Use RND_LEGACY for:
- Initial system modeling and dependency mapping
- Understanding complex infrastructure interactions
- Identifying non-obvious critical paths
- Planning for worst-case scenarios

2. Use RND for:
- Mid-level project planning
- Stage-based operations
- Resource allocation planning
- Risk management across project phases

3. Use NFJ for:
- Critical safety procedures
- Regulatory compliance processes
- High-risk operations requiring strict control
- Quality assurance workflows

A hybrid approach might be best: use RND_LEGACY for overall system modeling, RND for phase planning, and NFJ for critical procedure execution. This would give you the flexibility to model complex real-world dependencies while maintaining strict control over critical processes.
