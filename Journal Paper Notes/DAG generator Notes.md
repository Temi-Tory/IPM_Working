Adapting the ReachabilityModule to handle weighted probability slices.
Mathematical Foundation:
The core probability calculations occur in three key functions that need modification:

Regular Belief Calculation (calculate_regular_belief):
Currently multiplies single probability values. For slices, we'll compute probability products of value pairs with associated weights. Each parent node contributes multiple probability slices, and we multiply these with edge probability slices. For example, if a parent node has probability slices [(0.95, 0.3), (0.98, 0.7)] and the edge has slices [(0.8, 0.4), (0.9, 0.6)], we compute all combinations with their respective weights.
Diamond Structure Handling (calculate_diamond_groups_belief):
The diamond calculation currently uses updateDiamondJoin which computes success and failure cases. This needs to handle multiple slices for both the fork node beliefs and the edge probabilities. The final combination formula (success_belief * original_fork_belief + failure_belief * (1 - original_fork_belief)) needs to be applied across all slice combinations.
Inclusion-Exclusion Implementation (inclusion_exclusion):
The current implementation handles simple probability values in the PIE formula. For slices, we need to:


Consider all slice combinations when computing intersections
Maintain proper weight combinations through the calculation
Apply PIE formula while preserving the weighted nature of probabilities

Implementation Plan Referencing Original Module:

Regular Belief Calculation:


Expand calculate_regular_belief to handle slice multiplication
Reference lines 449-467 in original module for integration
Maintain error checking for missing values


Diamond Structure Processing:
